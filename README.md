# 🌍 GIS & Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Slade Laszewski, a geographer, environmental scientist and data analyst with experience in GIS, remote sensing, and environmental modeling. This page showcases a collection of my work, including interactive maps, code notebooks, and spatial data visualizations.

## 🔎 Featured Projects

### 💧 Hydrosocial Territories: Mapping Water-Society Relations

Understanding water systems requires more than just modeling hydrological ecological health insight into how water is embedded in social, political, and territorial dynamics. My work on **hydrosocial territories** explores water governance, land cove/use, and ecosystem services through spatial analysis and geographic information science.

**Hydrosocial territories** are spaces where water and society are co-produced—shaped by infrastructure, policy, local knowledge, and ecological processes. Using GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modeling, I investigate how water rights, access, and environmental interventions reshape these territories over time.

#### 🔍 Key Areas of Focus:
- Mapping irrigation networks and watershed boundaries  
- Analyzing land use change and water policy impacts  
- Integrating socio-political data with hydrological models  
- Visualizing contested spaces of water access and control  

#### 🧪 Tools & Methods:
Python (Rasterio, Arcpy, geopandas), ArcGIS Pro, MATLAB

### 🌲 Wildland-Urban Interface & Population Change

As population growth accelerates along the **Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)**, the intersection of human settlement and natural landscapes becomes a site of critical environmental concern. This project explores the spatial patterns of population increase in proximity to fire-prone regions, highlighting how land use, urban expansion, and ecological vulnerability intersect.

Using demographic data, land cover classifications, and spatial overlays, I assess patterns of growth across WUI zones and examine their implications for wildfire risk, resource management, and land-use policy.

🛰️ **Methods & Tools**: ArcGIS Pro, US Census Data, Land Cover Data, QGIS, Python
