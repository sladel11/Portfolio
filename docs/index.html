  <h1>🌍 GIS &amp; Data Analysis Portfolio</h1>

  <p>Welcome! I'm <strong>Slade Laszewski</strong>, a geographer, environmental scientist and data analyst with experience in GIS, remote sensing, and environmental modeling. This page showcases a collection of my work, including interactive maps, code notebooks, and spatial data visualizations.</p>

  <h2>🔎 Featured Projects</h2>

  <h3>💧 Hydrosocial Territories: Mapping Water-Society Relations</h3>
  <p>Understanding water systems requires more than just modeling hydrological ecological health insight into how water is embedded in social, political, and territorial dynamics. My work on <strong>hydrosocial territories</strong> explores water governance, land cove/use, and ecosystem services through spatial analysis and geographic information science.</p>

  <p><strong>Hydrosocial territories</strong> are spaces where water and society are co-produced—shaped by infrastructure, policy, local knowledge, and ecological processes. Using GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modeling, I investigate how water rights, access, and environmental interventions reshape these territories over time.</p>

  <h4>🔍 Key Areas of Focus:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Mapping irrigation networks and watershed boundaries</li>
    <li>Analyzing land use change and water policy impacts</li>
    <li>Integrating socio-political data with hydrological models</li>
    <li>Visualizing contested spaces of water access and control</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>🧪 Tools &amp; Methods:</h4>
  <p>Python (Rasterio, Arcpy, geopandas), ArcGIS Pro, MATLAB</p>

  <h3>🌲 Wildland-Urban Interface &amp; Population Change</h3>
  <p>As population growth accelerates along the <strong>Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)</strong>, the intersection of human settlement and natural landscapes becomes a site of critical environmental concern. This project explores the spatial patterns of population increase in proximity to fire-prone regions, highlighting how land use, urban expansion, and ecological vulnerability intersect.</p>

  <p>Using demographic data, land cover classifications, and spatial overlays, I assess patterns of growth across WUI zones and examine their implications for wildfire risk, resource management, and land-use policy.</p>

  <p>🛰️ <strong>Methods &amp; Tools</strong>: ArcGIS Pro, US Census Data, Land Cover Data, QGIS, Python</p>

  <h3>🩺 Preventing Chronic Disease: Public Health GIS for Butler County</h3>

  <p>
    As part of a collaboration with the <strong>Butler County Health District</strong>, I developed interactive spatial applications to support public health planning and community outreach. These tools inform strategies for preventing chronic diseases, targeting at-risk populations, and improving access to essential resources.

  <h4>🥣 Food Access & Healthier Eating</h4>
  <p>
    This web map highlights the locations of soup kitchens, and food pantries offering healthy food across Butler County. The goal is to reduce rates of <strong>diabetes and heart disease</strong> by increasing access to nutritious options in underserved areas.

  <h4>🏠 Lead Risk: Age of Housing Units</h4>
  <p>
    This map displays the spatial distribution of housing units by construction year to assess potential exposure risks to <strong>lead-based paint</strong>, especially in homes built before 1978. It supports early childhood health initiatives and environmental safety programs.
