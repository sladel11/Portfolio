  <h1>🌍 GIS &amp; Data Analysis Portfolio</h1>

  <p>Welcome! I'm <strong>Slade Laszewski</strong>, a geographer, environmental scientist and data analyst with experience in GIS, remote sensing, and environmental modeling. This page showcases a collection of my work, including interactive maps, code notebooks, and spatial data visualizations.</p>

  <h2>🔎 Featured Projects</h2>

  <h3>💧 Hydrosocial Territories: Mapping Water-Society Relations</h3>
  <p>Understanding water systems requires more than just modeling hydrological ecological health insight into how water is embedded in social, political, and territorial dynamics. My work on <strong>hydrosocial territories</strong> explores water governance, land cove/use, and ecosystem services through spatial analysis and geographic information science.</p>

  <p><strong>Hydrosocial territories</strong> are spaces where water and society are co-produced—shaped by infrastructure, policy, local knowledge, and ecological processes. Using GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modeling, I investigate how water rights, access, and environmental interventions reshape these territories over time.</p>

  <h4> Key Areas of Focus:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Quantifying the ecosystem service of SM to VG</li>
    <li>Analyzing land use by the ecosystem service</li>
    <li>Integrating socio-political data with hydrological models</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A general overview of the lagged relationship between soil moisture and vegetation greenness in the context of ecoregion:</p>

  <h3>🌲 Wildland-Urban Interface &amp; Population Change</h3>
  <p>As population growth accelerates along the <strong>Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)</strong>, the intersection of human settlement and natural landscapes becomes a site of critical environmental concern. This project explores the spatial patterns of population increase in proximity to fire-prone regions, highlighting how land use, urban expansion, and ecological vulnerability intersect.</p>

  <p>Using demographic data, land cover classifications, and spatial overlays, I assess patterns of growth across WUI zones and examine their implications for wildfire risk, resource management, and land-use policy.</p>

  <h3>🩺 Preventing Chronic Disease: Public Health GIS for Butler County</h3>
  <p>
    As part of a collaboration with the <strong>Butler County Health District</strong>, I developed interactive spatial applications to support public health planning and community outreach. These tools inform strategies for preventing chronic diseases, targeting at-risk populations, and improving access to essential resources.

    This web map highlights the locations of soup kitchens, and food pantries offering healthy food across Butler County. The goal is to reduce rates of <strong>diabetes and heart disease</strong> by increasing access to nutritious options in underserved areas.

    This map displays the spatial distribution of housing units by construction year to assess potential exposure risks to <strong>lead-based paint</strong>, especially in homes built before 1978. It supports early childhood health initiatives and environmental safety programs.
