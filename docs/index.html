  <h1>üåç GIS &amp; Data Analysis Portfolio</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome! I'm <strong>Slade Laszewski</strong>, a geographer, environmental scientist, and data analyst with experience in GIS, remote sensing, and environmental modeling. This page showcases a collection of my work, including interactive maps, code repositories, and spatial data visualizations.
  </p>

  <h2>Featured Projects</h2>

  <!-- Hydrosocial Territories -->
  <h3>üíß Hydrosocial Territories: Mapping Water-Society Relations</h3>

  <p>
    Understanding water systems requires more than just modeling hydrological and ecological health‚Äîit requires insight into how water is embedded in political, and territorial dynamics. My work on <strong>hydrosocial territories</strong> explores water governance, land cover/use, and ecosystem services through spatial analysis and geographic information science.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Hydrosocial territories</strong> are spaces where water and society are co-produced‚Äîshaped by management, and ecological processes. Using GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modeling, I investigate how water rights, and modeling of soil moisture and vegetation phenology reshape these territories over time.
  </p>

  <h4>Key Areas of Focus:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Quantifying the ecosystem service of soil moisture to vegetation greenness</li>
    <li>Analyzing land use by ecosystem service </li>
    <li>Integrating socio-political data with ecohydrological models</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A general overview of the lagged relationship between soil moisture and vegetation greenness across ecoregions:</p>

  <!-- WUI and Population -->
  <h3>üå≤ Wildland-Urban Interface &amp; Population Change</h3>

  <p>
    As population growth accelerates along the <strong>Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI)</strong>, the intersection of human settlement and natural landscapes becomes a site of critical environmental concern. This project explores spatial patterns of population increase in fire-prone regions, highlighting how land use, urban expansion, and ecological vulnerability intersect.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using demographic data, land cover classifications, and spatial overlays, I assess WUI growth and its implications for wildfire risk, resource management, and land-use policy.

  <!-- Public Health GIS -->
  <h3>ü©∫ Preventing Chronic Disease: Public Health GIS for Butler County</h3>

  <p>
    In collaboration with the <strong>Butler County Health District</strong>, I developed interactive spatial tools to support public health planning and outreach. These applications help identify at-risk populations, inform prevention strategies, and improve access to critical services.
  </p>

  <h4>ü•£ Food Access & Healthier Eating</h4>

  <div style="text-align: center;">

  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
    This map displays soup kitchens and food pantries offering healthy options across Butler County. The goal is to reduce rates of <strong>diabetes and heart disease</strong> by increasing access to nutritious foods in underserved areas.

  <h4>üè† Lead Risk: Age of Housing Units</h4>

  <p>
  <div style="text-align: center;">

  </p>

  <p>
    This map highlights housing units by construction year to assess exposure risks to <strong>lead-based paint</strong>, especially in homes built before 1978. It supports childhood health and environmental safety efforts.

  <h3>ü™¶ Oxford Cemetery Headstone Mapping Project</h3>
<p>
  This collaborative mapping effort, in  <strong>Advanced GIS (GEO 442/542)</strong>, documents and analyzes the condition of headstones in the <strong>Oxford Cemetery</strong> using high-resolution drone imagery, ArcGIS Online, and the Field Maps App.
  I digitized over 100 headstones and went through qaulity assurance of past students submissions.
</p>

<p>
  The dashboard my team designed is an inventory and assessment of the physical condition, legibility, and historical attributes of each grave marker.
