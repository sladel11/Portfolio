	  <h1>About Me!</h1>
	  <section>
		<h2>Where It All Started</h2>
		<p>
			I am originally from Hampton, New Hampshire, and growing up on the seacoast, I found my passion for environmental remediation, a symbiotic urban form with ecosystems and diverse geographies. 
			My hometown, dependent on a resilient ecosystem for beach tourism, simultaneously had citizens disavowing protections as a hindrance to economic growth. 
			The complexities of local motivations for conservation brought forth my passion for studying ecosystem science to illustrate how human desires are innate to a healthy environment. 
		</p>
		<p>
			From middle school through high school, I spent running cross country along old railroad tracks and streets with no sidewalks, questioning how we had become so disconnected from our surroundings. 
			How can someone appreciate the place they grew up in if it passes by in a blur? 
			I was lucky to learn surfing, by no means a pro, where I came to understand the oceans force and rhythm.
			The mountains were equally captivating, skiing through their daunting and awe-inspiring forests.
		</p>
		<p>
			As time passed, my convictions manifested as concrete action. At fourteen, I became a vegetarian, embracing a lifestyle aligned with my values. 
			I found freedom through pole vaulting, and discovered a connection to the Earth through ceramics, a hobby that grounded me in creativity and intention.  
			These choices gave me confidence and a sense of purpose that extended beyond myself.
			I led a school district-wide composting plan, bringing compost bins to the cafeteria and educating children about reducing waste. 
			My experiences developed into my academic choices as I went to study for an undergraduate degree in California. 
		</p>

		<h2>My Undergraduate Career</h2>
		<p>
			The beginning of my academic journey was shaped by a fascination with physical sciences, policy, and mathematics. 
			I ultimately chose to study Environmental Science at Chapman University to engage more deeply with the coursework I found most compelling. 
			The path, however, was far from linear, I transferred universities once and changed my major twice. 
			These actions reflect not indecision, but my perseverance and genuine passion for finding the right academic fit. 
		</p>
		<h4>Outside the classroom, I remained actively involved on campus and in the community:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Part of the NCAA Division III track and field team as a pole vaulter</li>
			<li>Served on the Schmid College of Science Student Council to help shape college policy</li>
			<li>Contributed to research across two different labs and an institute</li>
			<li>Worked as an engineering intern at mLogica Inc</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			The most significant part of my undergraduate journey was my time as a research assistant at the Institute of Earth Computing and Human Observations (ECHO).  
			I initiated and led a research project investigating population change in wildfire-prone regions of California with the help of my professor Dr. Shenyue Jia. 
			Using ArcGIS Pro and demographic data, my team identified spatial trends in community vulnerability and exposure. 
			The project brought about a peer-reviewed publication, series of public presentations, and cartographic representations. 
			This work resonates with the values I’ve carried since childhood, merging scientific inquiry with urban and environmental dynamics, and exploring how human land use decisions shape both risk and resilience.		</p>

		<h2>My Graduate Career</h2>
		<p>
			Deciding what's next in life can be paralyzing, but the confidence gained from these experiences kept me determined to continue working towards my passions.
			While looking into the world, I was told by my aforementioned professor about an opportunity to receive my master's in geography on a graduate assistantship. 
			While geography was not a plan of study I saw for myself in the moment, it has become integral to my future endeavors. 
			Through this program, I have further developed skills in data visualization, machine learning, programming, hydrological and chemical modeling, and science policy advocacy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One opportunity for skill development I’m especially proud of is my involvement with the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Voices for Science program, where I’ve worked to advocate for science policy.
			Initially, I was part of a Congressional Visit Day with the AGU, where I learned about the importance of government funding and how scientists must engage with policymakers to demonstrate the value of their research. 
			This experience motivated me to apply for the AGU's Voices for Science fellowship. 
			Starting in the spring of 2024, I began communicating with state officials in New Hampshire about the importance of water preservation. 
			I am drafting a piece on water perceptions in science and society related to property rights and economic systems. 
			The piece is being formulated into a long-form prose to contextualize the importance of water governance throughout history.
		</p>
		
	<h2>What's Next?</h2>
	<p>
		As I look ahead, I plan to continue bridging the imagined gap between ecosystems and society.
		My experiences in geographic research, data analysis, and physcial sciences have solidified my desire to pursue work that informs policy, and promotes resource management and remediation.	
	</p>
	<p> 
		In the near term, I aim to apply my current skill set in the job market ranging from environmental science and programming to policy and data analysis. 
		By gaining deeper technical expertise in a position, I hope to contribute more effectively to interdisciplinary projects that address pressing societal concerns. 
		I am particularly interested in working on initiatives related to water quality, sustainable infrastructure, and climate resilience, where I can integrate both analytical and policy-driven approaches.
		This phase of my journey will be focused on bridging scientific knowledge with practical, real-world solutions that support communities and ecosystems alike.
