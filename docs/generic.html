	  <h1>About Me!</h1>
	  <section>
		<h2>Where It All Started</h2>
		<p>
			I am originally from Hampton, New Hampshire, and growing up on the seacoast, I found my passion for environmental remediation, a symbiotic urban form with ecosystems and diverse geographies. 
			My hometown, dependent on a resilient ecosystem for beach tourism, simultaneously had citizens disavowing protections as a hindrance to economic growth. 
			The complexities of local motivations for conservation brought forth my passion for studying ecosystem science to illustrate how human desires are innate to a healthy environment. 
		</p>
		<p>
			From middle school through high school, I spent running cross country along old railroad tracks and streets with no sidewalks, questioning how we had become so disconnected from our surroundings. 
			How can someone appreciate the place they grew up in if it passes by in a blur? 
			I was lucky to learn surfing, by no means a pro, where I came to understand the oceans force and rhythm.
			I found the mountains equally captivating, skiing through daunting and awe-inspiring forests.
		</p>
		<p>
			As time passed, my convictions manifested as concrete action. I became a vegetarian at fourteen and found freedom in pole vaulting.
			My choices gave me confidence, supporting action beyond myself. 
			I led a school district-wide composting plan, bringing compost bins to the cafeteria and educating children about reducing waste. 
			My experiences developed into my academic choices as I went to study for an undergraduate degree in California.

		<h2>My Undergraduate Career</h2>
		<p>
			The beginning of my academic journey was shaped by a fascination with physical sciences, policy, and mathematics. 
			I ultimately chose to study Environmental Science at Chapman University to engage more deeply with the coursework I found most compelling. 
			The path, however, was far from linear, I transferred universities once and changed my major twice. 
			These actions reflect not indecision, but my perseverance and genuine passion for finding the right academic fit. 
		</p>
		<h4>Outside the classroom, I remained actively involved on campus and in the community:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Part of the NCAA Division III track and field team as a pole vaulter</li>
			<li>Served on the Schmid College of Science Student Council to help shape college policy</li>
			<li>Contributed to research across two different labs and an institute</li>
			<li>Worked as an engineering intern at mLogica Inc</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			The most significant part of my undergraduate journey was my time as a research assistant at the Institute of Earth Computing and Human Observations (ECHO).  
			I initiated and led a research project investigating population change in wildfire-prone regions of California with the help of my professor Dr. Shenyue Jia. 
			Using ArcGIS Pro and demographic data, my team identified spatial trends in community vulnerability and exposure. 
			The project brought about a peer-reviewed publication, series of public presentations, and cartographic representations. 
			This work resonates with the values I’ve carried since childhood, merging scientific inquiry with urban and environmental dynamics, and exploring how human land use decisions shape both risk and resilience.		</p>
