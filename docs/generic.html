	  <h1>About Me!</h1>
	  <section>
		<h2>Where It All Started</h2>
		<p>
			I am originally from Hampton, New Hampshire, and growing up on the seacoast, I found my passion for data analysis, the environment and diverse geographies. 
			My hometown, dependent on a resilient ecosystem for beach tourism, simultaneously had citizens disavowing protections as a hindrance to economic growth. 
			The complexities of local motivations for conservation brought forth my desire for studying ecosystem science, as a way to illustrate how human desires are innate to a healthy environment. 
		</p>
		<p>
			From middle school through high school, I spent running cross country along old railroad tracks.
			I was lucky to learn surfing, by no means a pro, where I came to understand the oceans force.
			The mountains were equally captivating, skiing through their daunting forests.
		</p>
		<p>
			As time passed, my convictions manifested as concrete action. At fourteen, I became a vegetarian. 
			I found freedom through pole vaulting, and discovered a connection to the Earth through ceramics, a hobby that grounded me in creativity and intention.  
			These choices gave me confidence and a sense of purpose that extended beyond myself.
			I led a school district-wide composting plan, bringing compost bins to the cafeteria and educating children about reducing waste. 
			My experiences developed into my academic choices as I went to study for an undergraduate degree in California. 
		</p>

		<h2>My Undergraduate Career</h2>
		<p>
			The beginning of my academic journey was shaped by a fascination with physical sciences, policy, and mathematics. 
			I ultimately chose to study Environmental Science at Chapman University to engage with the coursework I found most compelling. 
			The path, however, was far from linear, I transferred universities once and changed my major twice. 
			These actions reflect not indecision, but my perseverance and genuine passion for finding the right academic fit. 
		</p>
		<h4>Outside the classroom, I remained actively involved on campus and in the community:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>Part of the NCAA Division III track and field team as a pole vaulter</li>
			<li>Served on the Schmid College of Science Student Council to help shape college policy</li>
			<li>Contributed to research across two different labs and an institute</li>
			<li>Worked as an engineering intern at mLogica Inc</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			The most significant part of my undergraduate journey was my time as a research assistant at the Institute of Earth Computing and Human Observations (ECHO).  
			I initiated and led a research project investigating population change in wildfire-prone regions of California with the help of my professor Dr. Shenyue Jia. 
			Using ArcGIS Pro and demographic data, my team identified spatial trends in community vulnerability and exposure. 
			The project brought about a peer-reviewed publication, series of public presentations, and cartographic representations. 
			This work resonates with the values I’ve carried since childhood, merging scientific inquiry with urban and environmental dynamics.		
		</p>

		<h2>My Graduate Career</h2>
		<p>
			Deciding what's next in life can be paralyzing, but the confidence gained from these experiences kept me determined to continue working.
			While looking into the world, I was told by my professor about receiving my master's in geography on a graduate assistantship. 
			While geography was not a plan of study I saw for myself in the moment, it has become integral to my future endeavors. 
			Through this program, I have further developed skills in data visualization, machine learning, programming, hydrological and chemical modeling, and science policy advocacy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One skill development opportunity I’m especially proud of is my involvement in the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) Voices for Science program, where I’ve worked to advocate for science policy.
			It began with a Congressional Visit Day, where I learned how scientists can effectively engage with policymakers to highlight the value of their research. 
			Inspired by this, I joined the Voices for Science fellowship in spring 2024. Since then, I’ve been communicating with New Hampshire state officials about water preservation. 
		</p>
		
	<h2>What's Next?</h2>
	<p> 
		In the near term, I aim to apply my skill set, whether it be environmental science, programming, policy, or data analysis, in a professional setting. 
		I want to take on challenges that add value to an organization while expanding my own knowledge. 
		I’m especially motivated by opportunities that connect data to practical solutions.
